## setup
most important thing: Visual Studio ****Code****

### building the snippets/autocomplete
go to generation_scripts, open snippets.py (python 3)
copy the outputted file `snippets_build.json` and go to the .vscode folder
paste it and name it "plus.code-snippets" (yes, remove the json and make it code-snippets)
and you're done!

### good syntax highlight
download `C/C++ Extension Pack` for Visual Studio ****Code****
