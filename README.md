## setup
most important thing: Visual Studio ****Code****

### building the snippets/autocomplete
go to `generation_scripts`, open `snippets.py` (python 3)
copy the outputted file `snippets_build.json` and go to the .vscode folder
paste it and name it `plus.code-snippets` (yes, remove the json and make it `code-snippets`)
and you're done!

### building the icons
go to `generation_scripts`, go to `iconbuilder`, open `build.py` (python 3)
go inside `j2a` and you'll find the built anims file named `icons.j2a`

### good syntax highlight
download `C/C++ Extension Pack` for Visual Studio ****Code****

### notes
a palette has a max of 256 colors, ALL icons should use the default JJ2 palette, My friend [Cranky](https://www.github.com/) has helped me with icons and provided me with a JASC PaintShop Pro 8 Palette, which i have added in the `sprites` folder
