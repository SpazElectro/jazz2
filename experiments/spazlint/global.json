These new layer objects may then be inserted into the set of layers drawn to the screen by use of jjLayerOrderSet.\nBy default, the tile IDs of the tiles in these layers will be unchanged, meaning that unless the tileset used by the level filename is the same as is used by this level, the results will likely look very peculiar. (Similarly, any animated tiles used in those layers should probably match those used in this level.) In fact, you may want to make a special unplayable level just for the sake of taking its miscellaneous background or foreground layers into this one (and if you do, remember to tick \"Hide level in Home Cooked Levels list\" in its level properties). Alternatively, the optional tileIDAdjustmentFactor parameter is a value added to the tile IDs of any non-zero, non-animated tiles in the layer/s imported from filename, so for instance, if tileIDAdjustmentFactor equals 10, then a series of tiles 5,6,0,0,3 would become 15,16,0,0,13.

If it's negative, it will be sent to all clients with the exception of the one indicated by toClientID. Using the default value of 0 results in sending the packet to all clients. For a script to receive packet, you will need to declare an onReceive hook, which has the following signature:\n\t\t\tvoid onReceive(jjSTREAM &in packet, int fromClientID)\n\t\t\tNotice that packets can't be sent between two clients but only between the server and a client; if the function is called client-side, the toClientID argument is completely ignored. If a client is meant to send a packet to another client, they have to send the packet to the server first and the server should resend it to the other client from onReceive.\nIf there are multiple distinct script modules running (two or more mutators, or one mutator and a level's primary script), the packet will only be received by the module whose jjScriptModuleID global value matches the toScriptModuleID parameter. By leaving this parameter as the default value, you can ensure that a packet sent from foo.j2mut will always be read by (the onReceive hook defined in) foo.j2mut, rather than another, simultaneously running module that wouldn't know what to do with the data. Passing 0 instead will send the packet to the level's primary script (if any), and is rarely a good idea.
