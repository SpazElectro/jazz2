If paletteColorMapping is not null and is of length 256 or greater, it will be used to recolor the imported tiles in a way that better fits the palette you are currently using, e.g. pixels of color 10 will be changed to paletteColorMapping[10] instead. Returns false upon various reasons for failure.\njjTilesFromTileset is primarily intended to be combined with jjLayersFromLevel and jjLayerOrderSet, and the three should ideally be called in that order, so that jjLayersFromLevel has the right tiles to use in its new layers. Here is a sample script that imports the background pillars from Dungeon Dilemma (into any level using any tileset) and recolors them to use colors from the textured background:\n\t\t\tvoid onLevelLoad() {\n\tconst int oldTileCount = jjTileCount; //the number of tiles in the level's tileset before jjTilesFromTileset increases the number\n\tarray<uint8> pillarColorMapping(256);\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i)\n\t\tpillarColorMapping[i + 128] = i + 192; //map pillars' colors (stored in palette indices 128 through 143) to the (second row of) textured background colors\n\tjjTilesFromTileset( //appends tiles to the end of the internal copy of the tileset used by the current level\n\t\t\"Castle1.j2t\", //filename to take tiles from\n\t\t420, //first tile ID in tileset to take\n\t\t60, //number of tiles to take\n\t\tpillarColorMapping //an array<uint8>(256) that maps colors in the source tileset to colors in the destination tileset, here only working on a single 16-color gradient because that's all that is used in those particular two layers\n\t);\n\tarray<jjLAYER@> castleLayers = jjLayersFromLevel( //builds new jjLAYER instances from the layers defined in this level\n\t\t\"Castle1.j2l\", //filename to take layers from\n\t\tarray<uint> = {5,6}, //which layers to grab\n\t\toldTileCount - 420 //a number to offset the non-zero tileIDs by: the pillars started at tile 420 in castle1.j2t, but here start at the end of the old tileset, aka oldTileCount\n\t);\n\tjjLayerOrderSet(array<jjLAYER@> = {jjLayers[1], jjLayers[2], jjLayers[3], jjLayers[4], castleLayers[0], castleLayers[1], jjLayers[5], jjLayers[6], jjLayers[7], jjLayers[8]}); //insert the two layers from castle1.j2l between Layer 4 and Layer 5\n}\n"}, "jjTriggerRock": {"prefix": "jjTriggerRock", "body": "jjTriggerRock", "description": "Activates all Rotating Rock events with the \"RockID\" parameter set to id, exactly like the Trigger Rock event.\n"}, "jjUnixTimeMs": {"prefix": "jjUnixTimeMs", "body": "jjUnixTimeMs", "description": "Returns unix time in milliseconds, i.e. the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds.\n"}, "jjUnixTimeSec": {"prefix": "jjUnixTimeSec", "body": "jjUnixTimeSec", "description": "Returns unix time in seconds, i.e. the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds.\n"}, "jjUpdateTexturedBG": {"prefix": "jjUpdateTexturedBG", "body": "jjUpdateTexturedBG", "description": "Forces JJ2+ to reconstruct the textured background from its relevant properties.
