Set to any non-existing layer number to make water invisible. Note that this is a purely visual setting, and putting water behind the sprite layer will not prevent players from swimming in it. If the order of layers has been changed, this property's distance from 4 is its distance from the sprite layer, e.g. leaving it at 1 means that it will be drawn in front of the third layer in front of the sprite layer.
