The first version will call BEHAVIOR::BOUNCERBULLET while the object's state is still STATE::START; the second version will call jjObjectPresets[1].behavior and only switch the object's behavior to BEHAVIOR::BOUNCERBULLET after it has already been initialized and its state likely changed to something else. The same distinction applies to setting the object's xOrg/yOrg, creatorType, and creatorID properties as parameters to the function or later on. See jjBEHAVIORINTERFACE.\n",

For example, a swinging platform will call jjDrawSpriteFromCurFrame many times over, once for each of its chain links, in the middle of its behavior function, but the links won't actually get drawn to the screen until later in the game cycle. Native JJ2 code uses this method for everything but HUD graphics.\nThe layerZ parameter specifies which layer, 1-8, the graphic should be drawn in front of as its Z-index. Unlike the jjCANVAS hooks, this can be used even for layers that don't have any tiles. JJ2 draws sprites exclusively(?) in front of layers 3, 4, and 5, but you're welcome to experiment.\nThe layerXY parameter specifies which layer, 1-8, the graphic should be positioned relative to the top left corner of. JJ2 always, always does layer 4, but you can vary it up a bit. Unfortunately the game cycle is ordered so that the layers besides layer 4 may actually move around a little after the instruction is registered but before the graphic is drawn, so these drawing instructions will always be one frame behind. Here the jjCANVAS methods have a clear advantage.\nIf the order of layers has been changed, then layerZ and layerXY's distance from 4 are their distance from the sprite layer, e.g. 3 means not necessarily jjLayers[3], but rather 4-1, the first layer in front of the sprite layer, whichever jjLAYER that happens to be.\nThe playerID parameter specifies which player should see the drawn graphic, 0-31, or -1 for all of them (restricted only to players with true isLocal). Drawing for one player a time is used by JJ2+ to, for example, draw fastfire pickups as green/blue or normal/powered-up depending on the charCurr and powerup[1] values of each jjPLAYER viewing them. When spectating, sprites are drawn for the player ID of the spectator, not the spectatee.\n",

For example, a swinging platform will call jjDrawSpriteFromCurFrame many times over, once for each of its chain links, in the middle of its behavior function, but the links won't actually get drawn to the screen until later in the game cycle. Native JJ2 code uses this method for everything but HUD graphics.\nThe layerZ parameter specifies which layer, 1-8, the graphic should be drawn in front of as its Z-index. Unlike the jjCANVAS hooks, this can be used even for layers that don't have any tiles. JJ2 draws sprites exclusively(?) in front of layers 3, 4, and 5, but you're welcome to experiment.\nThe layerXY parameter specifies which layer, 1-8, the graphic should be positioned relative to the top left corner of. JJ2 always, always does layer 4, but you can vary it up a bit. Unfortunately the game cycle is ordered so that the layers besides layer 4 may actually move around a little after the instruction is registered but before the graphic is drawn, so these drawing instructions will always be one frame behind. Here the jjCANVAS methods have a clear advantage.\nIf the order of layers has been changed, then layerZ and layerXY's distance from 4 are their distance from the sprite layer, e.g. 3 means not necessarily jjLayers[3], but rather 4-1, the first layer in front of the sprite layer, whichever jjLAYER that happens to be.\nThe playerID parameter specifies which player should see the drawn graphic, 0-31, or -1 for all of them (restricted only to players with true isLocal). Drawing for one player a time is used by JJ2+ to, for example, draw fastfire pickups as green/blue or normal/powered-up depending on the charCurr and powerup[1] values of each jjPLAYER viewing them.

For example, jjLayersFromLevel(\"castle1.j2l\", array<uint> = {5,6}); returns an array with two layers, one of width 23 and height 25 and the other of width 20 and height 11, containing different sets of pillars as defined in Layer 5 and Layer 6 of castle1.j2l. These new layer objects may then be inserted into the set of layers drawn to the screen by use of jjLayerOrderSet.\nBy default, the tile IDs of the tiles in these layers will be unchanged, meaning that unless the tileset used by the level filename is the same as is used by this level, the results will likely look very peculiar. (Similarly, any animated tiles used in those layers should probably match those used in this level.) In fact, you may want to make a special unplayable level just for the sake of taking its miscellaneous background or foreground layers into this one (and if you do, remember to tick \"Hide level in Home Cooked Levels list\" in its level properties). Alternatively, the optional tileIDAdjustmentFactor parameter is a value added to the tile IDs of any non-zero, non-animated tiles in the layer/s imported from filename, so for instance, if tileIDAdjustmentFactor equals 10, then a series of tiles 5,6,0,0,3 would become 15,16,0,0,13.

If toClientID is a positive value, the packet will be sent only to the client with the appropriate jjPLAYER::clientID. If it's negative, it will be sent to all clients with the exception of the one indicated by toClientID. Using the default value of 0 results in sending the packet to all clients. For a script to receive packet, you will need to declare an onReceive hook, which has the following signature:\n\t\t\tvoid onReceive(jjSTREAM &in packet, int fromClientID)\n\t\t\tNotice that packets can't be sent between two clients but only between the server and a client; if the function is called client-side, the toClientID argument is completely ignored. If a client is meant to send a packet to another client, they have to send the packet to the server first and the server should resend it to the other client from onReceive.\nIf there are multiple distinct script modules running (two or more mutators, or one mutator and a level's primary script), the packet will only be received by the module whose jjScriptModuleID global value matches the toScriptModuleID parameter. By leaving this parameter as the default value, you can ensure that a packet sent from foo.j2mut will always be read by (the onReceive hook defined in) foo.j2mut, rather than another, simultaneously running module that wouldn't know what to do with the data. Passing 0 instead will send the packet to the level's primary script (if any), and is rarely a good idea. Other values are even more rarely a good idea.\n",

If paletteColorMapping is not null and is of length 256 or greater, it will be used to recolor the imported tiles in a way that better fits the palette you are currently using, e.g. pixels of color 10 will be changed to paletteColorMapping[10] instead. Returns false upon various reasons for failure.\njjTilesFromTileset is primarily intended to be combined with jjLayersFromLevel and jjLayerOrderSet, and the three should ideally be called in that order, so that jjLayersFromLevel has the right tiles to use in its new layers. Here is a sample script that imports the background pillars from Dungeon Dilemma (into any level using any tileset) and recolors them to use colors from the textured background:\n\t\t\tvoid onLevelLoad() {\n\tconst int oldTileCount = jjTileCount; //the number of tiles in the level's tileset before jjTilesFromTileset increases the number\n\tarray<uint8> pillarColorMapping(256);\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i)\n\t\tpillarColorMapping[i + 128] = i + 192; //map pillars' colors (stored in palette indices 128 through 143) to the (second row of) textured background colors\n\tjjTilesFromTileset( //appends tiles to the end of the internal copy of the tileset used by the current level\n\t\t\"Castle1.j2t\", //filename to take tiles from\n\t\t420, //first tile ID in tileset to take\n\t\t60, //number of tiles to take\n\t\tpillarColorMapping //an array<uint8>(256) that maps colors in the source tileset to colors in the destination tileset, here only working on a single 16-color gradient because that's all that is used in those particular two layers\n\t);\n\tarray<jjLAYER@> castleLayers = jjLayersFromLevel( //builds new jjLAYER instances from the layers defined in this level\n\t\t\"Castle1.j2l\", //filename to take layers from\n\t\tarray<uint> = {5,6}, //which layers to grab\n\t\toldTileCount - 420 //a number to offset the non-zero tileIDs by: the pillars started at tile 420 in castle1.j2t, but here start at the end of the old tileset, aka oldTileCount\n\t);\n\tjjLayerOrderSet(array<jjLAYER@> = {jjLayers[1], jjLayers[2], jjLayers[3], jjLayers[4], castleLayers[0], castleLayers[1], jjLayers[5], jjLayers[6], jjLayers[7], jjLayers[8]}); //insert the two layers from castle1.j2l between Layer 4 and Layer 5\n}\n",
